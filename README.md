# Ethical Implications:

When building an application such as a recipe book there are certain ethical and professional responsibilities that need to be considered when building the application we are making. These responsibilities pertain to the reliability, accessibility, and integrity of the information that is being stored in the servers the recipe book reaches out to. When storing user information, we want to consider maintaining the integrity or security of private information that clients may not want others to know. Customers want to know that a website can securely house their data without worrying about getting hacked. Accessibility is important to ensure that people who may be differently abled have ease of access when using the application, helping to enhance inclusivity.
Engineering solutions can have a real impact on global, economic, environmental, and societal contexts. For example, the food recipe website our team is building allows people to share, view, and edit recipes. At first, I didnâ€™t think much of it, but I realized food plays a huge role in bringing people together across different cultures worldwide. Economically, a well-organized, efficient site saves users time and could even support small businesses or aspiring chefs looking to promote their work. Environmentally, encouraging digital recipe sharing reduces the need for printed cookbooks and helps minimize waste. As an industrial and systems engineering student, this project showed me how even simple designs focused on efficiency and user-friendliness can make a meaningful societal impact by promoting connection, culture, and accessibility.
