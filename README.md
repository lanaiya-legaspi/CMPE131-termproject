# Ethical Implications:


Engineering solutions can have a real impact on global, economic, environmental, and societal contexts. For example, the food recipe website our team is building allows people to share, view, and edit recipes. At first, I didnâ€™t think much of it, but I realized food plays a huge role in bringing people together across different cultures worldwide. Economically, a well-organized, efficient site saves users time and could even support small businesses or aspiring chefs looking to promote their work. Environmentally, encouraging digital recipe sharing reduces the need for printed cookbooks and helps minimize waste. As an industrial and systems engineering student, this project showed me how even simple designs focused on efficiency and user-friendliness can make a meaningful societal impact by promoting connection, culture, and accessibility.
